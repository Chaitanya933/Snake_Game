Key Features:
Game Board: A grid-based area where the snake moves. In your version, the board has a width of 700px.

Snake: The main character of the game, which grows longer with each food item consumed.

Food: Randomly appearing objects that the snake must eat to grow.

Score: Increases as the snake consumes food.

Controls: Usually controlled via arrow keys, where each key corresponds to a direction (up, down, left, right).

Game Over Conditions: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

Development Details:
Languages: The game is typically developed using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic.

Responsive Design: Ensure the game board adapts to different screen sizes, especially since you have customized the width to 700px.

Challenges: Managing the increasing length of the snake and ensuring it doesn't overflow the board or crash into itself is key to gameplay.
